### Putative Disease Proteins Detection

In this section we used tool called DIAMOnD (https://github.com/barabasilab/DIAMOnD).

We just changed some commands in order to run it on python3. And as input we put files: seed.txt and all4.txt.
First one contains seed genes, second one contains PPI network. Results stored in first_200_added_nodes_weight_1.txt.

And then we used enrichr. There are results attached here.
